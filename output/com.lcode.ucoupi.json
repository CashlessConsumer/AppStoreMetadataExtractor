The transaction history shows details of all payment and collect requests. Using Add beneficiary, the customer can add beneficiary of other banks for doing payments.<br>The Unified Payment Interface allows payments to be initiated by the payer, or by the payee. In the basic payee initiated flows, the payment request is routed by the initiating application through the NPCI switch to the payer for approval. However, in certain instances, where it is possible to connect with the payer immediately, it is preferred that the payee sends a payment request to the payer, who can then initiate the payment request with his credentials.<br>Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an architecture and a set of standard APIs to facilitate the next generation online immediate payments leveraging trends such as increasing smartphone adoption, Indian language interfaces, and universal access to Internet and data. UPI is launched by National Payments Corporation of India with Reserve Bank of India&#39;s vision of migrating towards a &#39;less-cash&#39; and more digital society. NPCI has built on the Immediate Payment Service(IMPS) platform through which one could transfer money instantly by going online-by adding another layer that allows easy debit capability even on mobile phones.","short_description":"UCO UPI-One App for all your Banking needs","price":"","size":{"current":{"discovered_at":"2016-08-30 10:55:04 UTC","confirmed_at":"2016-12-26 18:17:10 UTC","data":6672380},"history":[{"discovered_at":"2016-08-30 10:55:04 UTC","confirmed_at":"2016-12-26 18:17:10 UTC","data":6672380}]},"permissions":["android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION","android.permission.ACCESS_CORSE_LOCATION","android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION","android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE","android.permission.CALL_PHONE","android.permission.CAMERA","android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS","android.permission.GET_TASKS","android.permission.INTERNET","android.permission.NETWORK","android.permission.READ_CONTACTS","android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE","android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE","android.permission.READ_SMS","android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS","android.permission.SEND_SMS","android.permission.USE_CREDENTIALS","android.permission.WAKE_LOCK","android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE","com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE","com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES","com.lcode.ucoupi.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"],"screenshots":["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tUONkLS8pbxwEnVJbibIHtLcF1RAP4WpkM3cfiC7os6Lbn_V88UfPtSYhRsB46pLUw","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0K_fhFFU7mKE04_cWIep2Sqf9N0ltEgomipcy68bsd1__f_3gPl_sWuSXEPGqRMc_A","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xRxDGVC99ItneV4FIYEcbDJAj0VmwrGwwPVZxU0YPeQs9jZbKdT9KBPPhTMFlz6CEw","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bt9AvwAtUoV3Yt1c1ccWlJpQXsFNkTE_kPRH4Wo8Wb0z8wDOGZ6hQmwcJgLoNZibow","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gsqudJuXdz7CqD3bx9z1TNIfhjBk8XuraT16qUrjORQNBUYKSE6kTvj3CVZFRRTbjw"],"videos":[],"feature_graphic":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jPJatKS4nyzHfuSR-6zSMCxhXwmdc_CTy6DYiKe6KEm4R3rMt65w3NU9UCbRl3Nfr90","content_rating":"3+","slug":"uco-upi"},"_robots_run_time":{"app_info_updater":{"in":{"en":"2016-12-26 18:17:10 UTC","in":"2016-08-30 10:55:06 UTC"},"kw":{"en":"2016-08-30 21:14:21 UTC"},"qa":{"en":"2016-11-17 11:40:40 UTC"},"om":{"en":"2016-11-24 19:04:36 UTC"},"ae":{"en":"2016-12-12 07:35:19 UTC"},"sa":{"en":"2016-12-13 11:55:27 UTC"}}},"developer":{"name":"UCO BANK","email":"uco.mbanking@ucobank.co.in","website":"http://www.ucobank.com"},"ratings":{"average":4.016417980194092,"count":670,"star_count":{"1":98,"2":26,"3":47,"4":95,"5":404}},"reviews":[],"country_rankings":[{"category_id":"FINANCE","type":"free","ranks":{"in":291}}],"country_code":"in","language":"en"},"metadata":{"request":{"path":"/applications/com.lcode.ucoupi.json","store":"android","params":{"country":"in","language":"en","today-rank":"0","id":"com.lcode.ucoupi","format":"json"},"performed_at":"2017-01-24 22:39:11 UTC"},"content":{}}}
